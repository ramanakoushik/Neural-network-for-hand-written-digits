# Neural-network-for-hand-written-digits
This is a read me file.
data.py is the script used to load the data from the folder

view.py is the script used to glance the digits and lables in the data

nn.py is the neural network with layers which predicts the output

canvas.py is the script which gives us a canvas to draw our custom digit and the NN predicts the output (currently under development)
